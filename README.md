# TerraformTutorials

Objective of this is to create a series for Terraform and AWS hands-on projects, that are easy to follow and understand

# **Prerequisites:**
Before you begin, you should have access to the following tools from your local machine: 

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) 
- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) 
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

# Creating AWS AutoScaling Group
[AWS AutoScaling Group](https://github.com/OklenCodes/Terraform-AWS-Tutorials/tree/main/AutoScalingGroup) - This contains the Terraform conifguration files for you to use to learn how to configure and scale an Auto Scaling group. Also related to the youtube video - https://youtu.be/1UtEyacje98

# Creating AWS IAM Policies 
[AWS IAM Policies](https://github.com/OklenCodes/Terraform-AWS-Tutorials/tree/main/IAMPolicies) - There are advantages to managing IAM policies in Terraform rather than manually in AWS. With Terraform, you can reuse your policy templates and ensure the principle of least privilege with resource interpolation.

In this tutorial, you will create an IAM user and an S3 bucket. Then, you will map permissions for that bucket with an IAM policy. Finally, you will attach that policy to the new user and learn how to iterate on more complex policies.
